Subject: AWS EC2 to Azure VM Instance Comparison for Hybrid Cloud Architecture  

Dear Team,  

As part of our hybrid cloud strategy, I have compiled a comparison of AWS EC2 instances and their performance-equivalent Azure VMs. This analysis will help us evaluate cost-effectiveness when transitioning between cloud providers while maintaining compatibility and stability with our current AWS EC2 configurations.  

The attached CSV file includes:  
- A list of Azure VM alternatives for AWS EC2 instances.  
- A comparison of On-Demand and Spot pricing for both Linux and Windows systems.  
- To ensure compatibility with our existing AWS configurations, most instances include options for both Series 5 and the latest Series 6 Azure VMs.  

This resource will serve as a reference for selecting the most suitable Azure VMs based on performance and pricing requirements.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

For AWS i3en instances (storage-optimized for high-performance workloads), the Azure equivalent requires attaching correspondingly sized high-performance Managed Disks (such as Ultra Disks or Premium SSD v2) to achieve comparable storage performance and capacity.
