Of course. Based on your precise clarification, here is the English explanation of the process flow.

### Process Flow Analysis

Your clarification is absolutely critical and correct. The process does not involve Aquila calling J5v3 directly. Instead, all API calls are routed through the Kong Gateway, which acts as a secure reverse proxy and single entry point.

Here is the refined, accurate flow:

### Refined Process Steps

The process consists of two main phases: first obtaining a token, and then using it to make authorized API calls through the gateway.

#### Phase 1: Token Acquisition (Authentication)

1.  Aquila Requests Token from Kong:
       The Aquila service sends an HTTPS request to a specific authentication endpoint on the Kong Gateway (e.g., `/oauth2/token`).
       It provides its credentials (e.g., `client_id` and `client_secret`) to prove its identity.

2.  Kong Validates and Issues Token:
       Kong receives the request. An authentication plugin (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) validates Aquila's credentials.
       If valid, Kong generates and returns an Access Token to Aquila.

#### Phase 2: API Call via Gateway (Authorization & Proxy)

3.  Aquila Calls the API through Kong:
       Aquila needs to order or delete an instance by calling the J5v3 API.
       Crucially, it does not call J5v3's internal address. Instead, it constructs a request to Kong's public API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.company.com/j5v3/instances`).
       It places the received Access Token in the `Authorization` header of this request (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`).

4.  Kong Validates the Token and Proxies the Request:
       Kong receives the request destined for its `/j5v3` endpoint.
       Routing: Kong identifies, based on the path, that this request should be routed to the upstream J5v3 service.
       Authentication & Authorization: Before proxying, a Kong plugin (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) intercepts the request:
           It validates the signature and expiry of the Access Token.
           (Optional) It checks if the token has permissions to perform the specific action (e.g., `DELETE` on `/instances`).
       Proxy: Only if all checks pass, Kong forwards the now-verified request to the actual, internal J5v3 service.

5.  J5v3 Processes the Request:
       J5v3 receives the request from Kong. It trusts that Kong has already handled authentication, so it can focus purely on business logic (e.g., deleting the instance).
       It sends a response back to Kong, which is then relayed back to the original caller, Aquila.

### Architectural Significance (Why This Matters)

This pattern is a cornerstone of modern microservices architecture:

   Single Entry Point: Kong acts as the front door for all API traffic. No client needs to know the internal network addresses of backend services.
   Decoupling: The Aquila service is completely decoupled from the J5v3 service. It only needs to know Kong's address. Changes to J5v3's location or implementation do not require updates to Aquila.
   Centralized Security: Security policies (auth, rate limiting, logging) are enforced in one place (Kong), rather than being duplicated across every backend service like J5v3. This is more robust and easier to manage.
   Client Consistency: For any client like Aquila, the method to call any service is identical: "Call the Kong endpoint and add the token."
